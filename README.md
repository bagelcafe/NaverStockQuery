# NaverStockQuery
Searching some financial data via NaverStock.
I'd like to know which company has more cash than market value.
This source code is to run and get the code and cash data to find the specific company in KOSPI 200.


Phase 1
naverstock.py is finding market value of the comapny in KOSPI200.

Phase 2
naverstock_sise.py is adding market value and stock code and company name.

Phase 3
naverstock_query.py is final source code to get the cash value from corporate code via Naver stock.
